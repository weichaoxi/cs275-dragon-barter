  	Welcome to Dragon Barter <br>
  	Students spend copious amounts of money on educational or education-related infrastructure each year. Such infrastructure can include items like textbooks, which are directly related to classroom learning, or can be indirectly related to an individual’s education, such as furniture for one’s living area to study. Often, these items are discarded at the end of a term for convenience's sake, leaving no salvage value. We wish to tackle the inconvenience of arranging exchanges with a simple-to-use web platform enabling students to trade their materials. Users will be able to quickly and efficiently utilize the site to post items to buy and sell and search for items to trade. Users will negotiate a time and place to perform the trade with interested buyers or sellers, and in doing so, establish connections with other users.
